  Advanced uncertainty propagation with Scipp
  </br></br>
</span>

[Scipp](https://scipp.github.io/) provides a basic facility for storing and propagating variances.
It can, however, not take correlations into account.
ScippUncertainty provides tools to this end.
Currently, only Monte-Carlo uncertainty propagation is implemented.
See the corresponding [user guide](./user-guide/mc.ipynb).
