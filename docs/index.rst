ScippUncertainty
================

Advanced uncertainty propagation with Scipp.

`Scipp <https://scipp.github.io/>`_ provides a basic facility for storing and propagating variances.
It can, however, not take correlations into account.
ScippUncertainty provides tools to this end.
Currently, only Monte-Carlo uncertainty propagation is implemented.
See the corresponding `user guide <./user-guide/mc.rst>`_.
